# Sternenfront – Changelog

Versions follow **alpha Phase.Teil.Paket.laufende Nummer** (see Roadmap.md → Arbeitsweise & Übergabe).
Every update gets its own entry, a commit and a git tag `v<version>`.

## alpha 0.4.19.17 – 2026-11-05

- Debug menu: "Reroll board here" also rerolls the station's faction contracts.

## alpha 0.4.19.16 – 2026-11-05

Formation flight and keyboard controls. 403 smoke-test checks pass.
- Followers fly a fixed V formation behind the lead and keep their slot for the whole warp.
- The lead of your group announces each warp and gate jump in the chat.
- WASD flies the ship (release: stop), the arrow keys pan the camera. Saved camera bindings from older
  versions are reset once.
- Tab selects the nearest hostile ship (again: the next one), B the nearest station within 5,000 km.

## alpha 0.4.19.15 – 2026-11-05

Convoy and group follow-ups, command hotkeys. 397 smoke-test checks pass.
- Group warp: the ship being followed warps at the speed of the slowest ship following it.
- After a pirate attack convoy ships no longer scatter; the convoy holds until no pirate is within its
  recon range and the pilot follows (≤ 8,000 km) or is right next to it (≤ 2,000 km); 2 min timeout.
- Your group (convoy, patrol, followed ship, followers) shows as green tiles at the top left.
- New rebindable hotkeys: R lock/unlock (nearest hostile if nothing selected), Q approach, X warp,
  J jump, G dock, F follow. Buttons show their key in the tooltip.

## alpha 0.4.19.14 – 2026-11-05

Patrol contracts work like convoy escorts now. 386 smoke-test checks pass.
- The contract gets its own patrol group: it starts at the issuing station (rolling out of its bays) or
  at a named gate/field, waits for the pilot (Follow or 3 s within 1,000 km), then flies its rounds.
- Marked green with a PATROL LEAD on combat view, radar and system map; Follow works (also in warp).
- Only flying with that group counts; it is released afterwards; if it is destroyed, the contract fails.
- Test fix: the notorious roaming test starts next to a safer system (was random).

## alpha 0.4.19.13 – 2026-11-04

**Package 19 – module size & quality system** (first package of Teil 4). 379 smoke-test checks pass.
**Old saves cannot be loaded any more** (save version 2) – please start a new game.
- Modules are family + size + quality ("Pulse Laser 2 · C"): 53 families, about 1,700 modules generated
  from size curves and quality factors (D lightest, F heaviest, B as heavy as A).
- Every hull slot has its own maximum size; smaller modules fit bigger slots; hyperdrive size sets the
  jump class.
- Outfitters stock sizes and qualities by station tier, manufacturing rolls the quality, military-grade
  gear is the biggest modules.
- Skiff and Longhaul are sold at shipyards, the Carrion Crow in Pirate Havens.
- Modules tab shows slot maxima and module size/quality; outfitter grouped by family.

## alpha 0.3.18.12 – 2026-11-04

Planning only: slot layouts of all nine current hulls agreed (per-slot sizes, core slots), hyperdrive
size ↔ jump class, Earthworks membership; the NPC-only hulls become buyable (Carrion Crow in Pirate
Havens, Skiff, Longhaul); patrols will fly their own faction's ships once the state manufacturers exist.

## alpha 0.3.18.11 – 2026-11-04

Planning only: the module system design for package 19 is agreed and recorded in the roadmap –
module = family + size + quality, size curves, smaller modules fit bigger slots, quality factors with
mass rules (D lightest, F heaviest, B as heavy as A), per-slot sizes for every ship.

## alpha 0.3.18.10 – 2026-11-04

Planning only (no gameplay change): all open questions of Teil 4 decided and recorded in the roadmap –
module system rebuilt from scratch (weapons size 1–4, slots defined per ship), quality F–A buyable and
S in the endgame, multi-focus as several active targets, drones limited by hangar + bandwidth, mines as
goods, radar jammer used by and against the player, type-0 station services, faction ships from
Neutral (top models Allied) at their own yards, specialised manufacturers starting with "Earthworks"
(today's hulls), about 24 ships, design discussed per manufacturer.

## alpha 0.3.18.9 – 2026-11-04

**Package 18 – Codex.** Teil 3 (NPCs and Factions) is complete. 365 smoke-test checks pass.
- In-game encyclopedia with 45 entries in six categories (Basics, History, Factions, Corporations,
  The Cluster, Technology); faction and corporation entries generated from their data.
- Ship menu tab "Codex"; "Codex" in the main menu shows everything discovered in any game.
- Basics known from the start, the rest unlocks on discovery (first dock, factions met, services used,
  colossi, havens, notorious pirates, raids, ion weapons, warp, gates, mining); "New Codex entry" notice.
- Roadmap: GitHub repository noted in the versioning rules.

## alpha 0.3.18.8 – 2026-11-04

First versioned state (git introduced). Phase 0.5, Teil 3 (NPCs and Factions): packages 10–17 done,
package 18 (Codex) is next. 354 automated smoke-test checks pass.
